Contents of LBC Folder:
I created this software with software tools that I crafted, feel free to distribute as is.

BW: stands for Bibleworks.  Copy all three files to your database folder in the Bibleworks install folder.

Logos:  Create a personal book with the lbc.txt.docx file.

Concordance:  Two documents: a concordance and a scripture index of the LBC.

BCO_2011.docx OPC Book of Church Order ready to be built as Logos personal book.

Scholars Edition of the London Baptist Confession.  Rather than just listing the scripture citation references, this verse prints out the full KJV text of the verse as many versions of the Westminster Confession.  However, there is more!  This scholars edition prints out the full text in multiple English, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew versions as well.  

More-Indexes directory contains indexes to the entire Westminister Standards, Keach's Catechism, and the Institutes.

WCF: A concordance to the WCF (brand new, have not tested it at all, open an Issue if you find bugs).  Concord.cpp is the code that does it.  I have a manual "exception" list of words not to include.  If the word passes those conditions, it does a database lookup to filter out pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, and articles.

Missing Verses Cited by Historical Writers: read the rationale here: https://www.sermonaudio.com/new_details3.asp?ID=125370
